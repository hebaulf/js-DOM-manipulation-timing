# Js DOM manipulation and timing

In this project I made a Whack-a-Mole game which I did with the help of a tutorial challenge from [Wes Bos' Javascript30 course](https://javascript30.com/). I also used the countdown clock challenge from the same course.
These are very fun javascript tutorials on how to create real life working projects displayed on a page using javascript.

I commented the code thoroughly and it should explain what each part is doing.

**Here is also some more info of what I used in the project:**

- I set a 2 sec timeout for a loading screen with an animated svg.
- The game has a scoreboard and also a countdown timer of 20 sec using setInterval.
- I used addEventListener both for the click on "Start Game" button and on the click of each mole to get a score point.
- I used css transition to move the moles up and down and added the class for transitioning using javascript (.classList.add() and .classList.remove())
- I also used sass in this project
